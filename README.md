Example talk viewable online [here](https://matthewfeickert.github.io/talk-CSS-template/index.html?p=talk.md)

## Setting up online viewing

To have the talk be hosted and rendered on the domain associated with your [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) in the repository settings under **GitHub Pages** set the **Source** to be master branch.
GitHub will then build and deploy the website everytime you push to `master`.
